Forecasting using prophet

I am excited to be using Prophet.  This will be the first time we are using AI to predict what will happen.   I thought it was very interesting to shift the data to allign the expected results that should change after something happens.   I also thought the rolling totaling was a good way to look at the data.

I didn't have much confdence in the predicted data though.  It seemed like the downward trend was more pronounced than the data supported.
